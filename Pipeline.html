            <p>
              A pipeline is basically a way of facilitating work amougst a group
              of people in order to create a product. In the context of the
              Animation Industry, this pipeline consists of several roles. Each
              piece of work is used by everyone in production and has to be
              essentially built off of in order to progress. If even one of
              these roles faulter, then the whole production gets held up.

            <h2>PRE-PRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
              This is the stage at which the Animation Committee greenlights a
              potential project. Most anime being made are adaptions of comics
              or manga through Shueisha/Shonen Jump or other publishers. Once
              the committee makes their decision, a studio is offered the
              project alongside a producer and director. Usually all of this
              happens roughly 2-3 years before the first episode of the work
              releases. Preproduction is where the character designs, script,
              and concept work is made. Many animators use these in order to
              adapt the directors vision accurately, so a good supply of
              materials is important for a healthy production.

          <h2>STORYBOARDING/コンテ & PLANNING</h2>
          <p>
            After the staff is chosen, the director(and sometimes the assistant
            director as well) will begin storyboarding the scenes, making
            revisions and discussing ideas with the assistant director,
            producers (production desk), and main staff (animators). Many
            studios have their own way of handling storyboards, for example the
            Upcoming Mononoke movie uses a lot of 3D assets to sell the
            perspective and compositions, while productions like Jujutsu Kaisen
            S3 and One Piece use rougher boards. Sometimes these approaches are
            due to either time constraints or wanting the animators to take
            creative liberties.

            the animator lays out the base foundation of the cut, being very
            rough but structural in the way that they draw, These artists have
            creative liberties on how they want to portray the motion and
            typically focus on the movement of the subjects.

            Director, and Chief Animation Director (Usually the person who drew
            the character designs). These artists are in charge of doing draw
            overs on top of the LO, sometimes making the drawings more on model
            and even fixing continuity errors, this is the stage where the
            drawings really matter, so the most skilled artist usually handles

            After the director check stage, someone has to go in and apply these
            new changes. There are 2 types of operations when it comes to
            cleaning up rough animation work, Genga and Nigen. If the original
            artist who did the LO comes back to clean the work, it is called
            Genga, but if another artist comes in to clean the work, then it is
            referred as Nigen. However the final result will always be called
            Genga. It is usually preferred if the original artist comes back to
            do the Genga, because not only do they understand the nuance of the
            lines and can add new creative changes if experienced enough, but
            its good work ethic to essentially clean up the rough work that was
            made. Sometimes if the Genga work is lacking, then the Chief
            animation director comes back to fix the work referred to as Genga
            Correction (Genga Sakkan).

            be strenuous since they have to trace over hundreds and inbetween

              After editing and thorough checks from the editing team and the director, the final episode is sent out for publishing and the process continues all over again

              On average about 12-13 episodes are produced per season and many studios work on multiple episodes at once, so the team isn't only focused on one part of the pipeline.
              There are more people nowadays working within this industry, bringing their own creative way of expressing themselves compared to back then. A lot of freelance jobs in the anime industry were taken by people who lived natively in Japan, but with the growth of social media and demand increase, freelance animators from all over the world take some of the workload of these major studios
