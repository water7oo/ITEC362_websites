              An Animation Studio is a place where major animated shows are
              mainly created. These studios sizes can vary from 100-2,000 active
              employees. These studios follow a specific pipeline in order
              produce high quality works year round. Each person has a hand full
              of roles to fufill <br />
              <br />
              Different studios specialize in their own creative way of
              expressing themselves, some studios like Studio Trigger have
              experience with using real life props (i.e Panty and Stocking with
              Gartabelt), while other animation studios like Studio Orange or
              Studio Mappa specialize integrating 3D works into their shows or
              handle 3D animation overall.

              As said before, Animation Studios tend to have around 100-2,000
              workers each with their own role in the pipeline. The most common
              role in these productions are the Animators and Directors. Roles
              like these go even further and have sub catagories or sub-roles
              that handle their own separate tasks
            </p>

            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              For instance, the average production there is usually a Series
              Director, Assistant Director, Animation Director and Chief
              Animation Director. Most of the time people can undergo more than
              3-4 of these roles.
